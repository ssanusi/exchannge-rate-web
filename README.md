## Live Demo

[Check out the live demo](https://cmacdonnacha.github.io/react-boilerplate/)

&nbsp;

## Set up

1. Click the `Use this Template` button or `git clone https://github.com/cmacdonnacha/react-boilerplate.git my-app`
2. `cd my-app`
3. `npm install`
4. That's it! See the **Available Commands** list below.

&nbsp;

## Available Commands

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. Use `npm run test:no-watch` to run tests without a watcher.<br />

### `npm run test:no-watch`

Runs tests without a watcher.

### `npm run test:coverage`

Displays the code coverage within the console and also generates a coverage folder.

> To view the code coverage report in your browser open the `index.html` file within the `coverage/lcov-report` folder.

### `npm run lint`

Runs the ESLint typescript code lint checker. Running `npm run lint:fix` will automatically fix any lint errors where possible.

### `npm run build`

Builds a production version of the app inside the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run analyze`

This will run a production build and then analyze the output using [source-map-explorer] which analyzes JavaScript bundles using their source maps. This helps you understand where code bloat is coming from.

In the dropdown on top left, click on `[number].[hash].chunk.js` to see which **node_modules** packages are taking up the most space or `main.[hash].chunk.js` which is the actual source code.

&nbsp;

## CI/CD

This boilerplate uses [Github actions][github-actions] to continuously test, build and deploy. You can see the workflow file in the [workflows](.github/workflows/continuous-integration-workflow.yml) folder.

If you would like to deploy your app to github pages make sure to set your own `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` variable. See [creating a token.](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line#creating-a-token). Otherwise you can remove the `deploy` job.

To enable github pages follow [these](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source) instructions.

&nbsp;

## Host your production build locally

This can be useful when testing production builds vs dev builds or checking how well your build is minified.

1. `npm run build`
2. `npx serve -s build`

&nbsp;

## Updating dependencies

`npm-check-updates` makes it easy to update your dependencies. All you have to do is run the following:

1. `npm install -g npm-check-updates`
2. `ncu -u` which displays the outdated dependencies and updates your `package.json` file.
3. `npm install` which will then install the new versions for you.

&nbsp;

## Clean git history

When cloning this repository you will get all of it's git history. If you would like to start fresh please do the following:

1. Delete the `.git` folder
2. `git init`

This will also clear the husky config (tool that checks passing tests before git commit) so to re-enable this you will need to `npm install --save-dev husky` again.

&nbsp;

## Testing

> [Write Tests. Not too many. Mostly integration.](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests)

The [react-testing-library][react-testing-library] is a great utility to work alongside Jest. It makes you focus more on writing tests the way an actual user would interact with your application.

## TODO

- Bug: Investigate issue with gh pages not working with very first workflow run after new clone. Currently I have to use global gh-pages package for first time `gh-pages -d build`.
